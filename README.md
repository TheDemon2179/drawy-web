# drawy-web
AI-generated site where you can draw.

If you are in a hurry and need to make a quick sketch, you may find this site handy.

It allows you to save the images you've drawn, has all the functions you need (for sketching): choosing the size, brush color, choosing the canvas size, and erasing.

There may be bugs on the site, but that's what AI-generated is all about. (sorry, Bing).

If you don't understand why people draw at all, then:

Drawing is an interesting activity because it allows you to express your feelings, fantasies, and views of the world. Drawing develops creative thinking, attention to detail, and aesthetic taste. Drawing can also be good for your psychological health because it helps relieve stress, relax, and enjoy the process.

So draw.
